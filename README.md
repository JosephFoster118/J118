# J118
A personal general purpose library I've been working on to help me learn and aid my other projects

# Why the name J118
The "J" is for my first name "Joseph" and the 118 is the team number of my VEX and FRC teams, The Robonauts. I chose to include this number becaue there is a little bit of Robonauts in every program I right.
