# J118
A personal general purpose library for everything I might need in other projects. This includes things such as concurrency and device management. I is meant to run for all archetectures (Minus some device features for Windows and Mac) so that it can be relied on for any enviroment. This encludes embedded systems such as Raspberry Pi's and Beaglebones.

# Why the name J118
The "J" is for my first name "Joseph" and the 118 is the team number of my VEX and FRC teams, The Robonauts. I chose to include this number becaue there is a little bit of Robonauts in every program I right.
